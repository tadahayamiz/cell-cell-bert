## Abstract
Extracting cell–cell communication (CCC) from biomedical literature is critical for understanding intercellular interactions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced NLP, their generative nature raises reliability concerns for scientific fact extraction, highlighting the need for transparent, domain-adapted models.

This work presents the **first systematic evaluation of fundamental design choices** for biomedical relation extraction (BioRE), focusing on CCC. Using a newly constructed dataset derived from SemMedDB and an independent PubMed test set, we report the following key findings:

- **Systematic Analysis:** We evaluated core design decisions: entity indication strategies, model architectures, and the necessity of continued pre-training (CPT).
- **Design Insights:** CPT substantially improved entity-aware architectures but had minimal effect on CLS-only models. Furthermore, "replacement" strategies generalized better to natural text than "boundary marking."
- **Superior Performance:** Our best model achieved an out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy of **0.757±0.009**, outperforming GPT-4o (0.715±0.012) while remaining lightweight and reproducible.

This repository provides the datasets, models, and design principles established in our study.
